Instructions The duration of this lab test is 1 hour. You are given a data file ( dataset.csv ) and an incomplete Python script file ( script.py ). Complete the tasks specified in the next section and submit the script.py through the submission link provided. In script.py file, you should only add or change codes that are enclosed within the blocks of ########## student's code ########## # your task description #################################### The codes within the blocks will be extracted automatically for marking purpose, therefore, do not add or modify code outside of these blocks as it will not be there during marking. You may run the script.py file to test your codes. It should run without error. Submission Only submit the script.py file. You do not need to rename the file zip the file submit the csv files Explanation of tasks The script.py is meant to perform clustering on data loaded from the dataset.csv file perform classification on the data with the clustering result save the outcome to a csv file Each task corresponds to one custom function. The data flow from one task/function to the next one has been done in the if __name__ == \"__main__\" block at the end of script.py .
